    <h2 class="heading2" id="FP">Functional Programming</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical
    functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations
    instead of statements.</p> <hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="IP">Imperative Programming </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in
    natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how
    a program operates</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="OOP">Object-Oriented Programming </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
      which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes;
    and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify
    the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="IT">Information Technology (IT)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">IT is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data or information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as
    opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT).
     An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system or, more specifically speaking, a computer system –
    including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of users.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="AI">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">The Study of artificial intelligence (AI) is closely related to the field of artificial life (AL), and both are involved in synthesizing goal-orientated
    processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, learning and communication using computers and algorithms. While the field of
    artificial life examines systems and studies the complex behaviors that emerge from these systems, artificial intelligence uses systems to develop specific
    behaviors in machines and software. AI is a cross-disciplinary topic drawing on applied mathematics, symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosophy
    (of mind), neurophysiology and social intelligence. AI involves the automation of tasks (such as evaluative and predictive tasks) in computer applications involving
    complex real-world data - successful use of AI in this manner can act as a viable substitute for humans doing the same tasks.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="CG">Computer Graphics </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Studying computer graphics involves using computers to create still or moving two or three dimensional images using specialized graphics hardware and software.
    You’ll study how to manipulate visual and geometric information using computational techniques, focusing on mathematical and computational foundations of image
    generation and processing rather than purely aesthetic issues. You’ll need knowledge of physics, light and materials, as well as knowledge of the mathematics of
    homogenous matrices, and of data storage, representation and manipulations. Computer graphics makes the interaction and understanding of computers and interpretation
    of data easier for both computing professionals and consumers. With companies exploring increased use of trends such as ‘gamification’, the demand for computer
    scientists with advanced knowledge of computer graphics has never been greater.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="PLT">Programming Language Theory </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">: Programming is an interdisciplinary topic, incorporating elements from subjects such as mathematics, software engineering and linguistics.
    Programming language theory involves looking at the design, implementation, analysis, characterization and classification of programming languages and
    their individual features. Your introductory courses will teach you one or more programming languages. Knowledge of more than one will help you to better
    understand their individual strengths and weaknesses, which will in turn help you to better engage with the challenges addressed by programming language theory.
    You’ll cover topics such as syntax, natural semantics, structural operational semantics and abstract machine code</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="DL">Deep Learning </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Deep learning is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use
    in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from
    data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="ML">Machine Learning (ML) </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">This is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.
    Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions
    without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision,
     where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

    <h2 class="heading2" id="IOT">Internet of Things (IoT) </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">It is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to
      transfer data over
    a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of multiple
    technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks,
    control systems, automation (including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market,
    IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", covering devices and appliances
    (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems,
    and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.</p><hr class="horizontal-line" />

ABET accreditation is assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which it prepares its students.
In the US there are currently twenty-five programs that exist in the entire country so careful college consideration is advised.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

<h2 class="heading2" id="GE">Geotechnical Engineering </h2>
<p class="paragraph">Geotechnical engineering is the discipline within civil engineering related to the performance of soil mechanics, including their subsurface conditions,
determination of the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties that will influence the project under consideration, and the assessment of the risks
that may be created by conditions of the site. After necessary evaluation, design of the earthworks is carried out, and subsequently supervision of the site,
foundation, and construction is carried out.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

<h2 class="heading2" id="SE">Structural Engineering</h2>
<p class="paragraph">A broad specialization of civil engineering, structural engineering is all about analyzing, planning, designing and overlooking the construction of large
structures like bridges, tunnels, buildings, flyovers etc.
As part of the course, students learn the basic principles of structural analysis which involves examining the strength, stability and durability of structures.
Typically, a structural engineer specializes in a particular field.
It could range from pipeline engineering to bridge engineering and from building engineering to huge air and water structures like aircraft and ships.
In India, the demand for structural engineers is high as every construction requires skilled engineers to maintain its durability and quality.
A large number of builders, contractors or architects hire structural engineers as their consultants.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

<h2 class="heading2" id="BE"> Bridge Engineering</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Bridges are part of our world and constitute one of the most interesting fields of structural engineering.
They serve us tirelessly, causing awe and admiration to those who cross them.
They stand silent and proud in a delicate agreement with nature, daring to challenge it, while respecting it.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1">

<h2 class="heading2" id="LD"> Land Development </h2>
<p class="paragraph">Land development puts more emphasis on the expected economic development as a result of the process;
"land conversion" tries to focus on the general physical and biological aspects of the land use change.
"Land improvement" in the economic sense can often lead to land degradation from the ecological perspective.
Land development and the change in land value does not usually take into account changes in the ecology of the developed area.
While conversion of (rural) land with a vegetation carpet to building land may result in a rise in economic growth and rising land prices,
the irreversibility of lost flora and fauna because of habitat destruction, the loss of ecosystem services and resulting decline in environmental</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="TE">Transporting Engineering</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Transportation engineering or transport engineering is the application of technology and scientific principles to the planning, functional design, operation
and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical,
and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods transport.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="HE"> Hydraullic Engineering</h2>
<p class="paragraph">A few examples of the fundamental principles of hydraulic engineering include fluid mechanics, fluid flow, behavior of real fluids, hydrology, pipelines,
open channel hydraulics, mechanics of sediment transport, physical modeling, hydraulic machines, and drainage hydraulics.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="COE">Coastal and Ocean Engineering</h2>
<p class="paragraph">The graduate program in coastal and ocean engineering at Oregon State University emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of research and education on
emerging themes related to coastal climate change including sea level rise and coastal storms, natural coastal hazards including tsunamis and hurricanes,
marine renewable energy, and coastal ecology and sustainable communities.
Our program seeks to enable students to pursue research topics that cross the traditional boundaries of coastal engineering, and to prepare students for
leadership positions in academia, private, and public sectors.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="EE"> Environmental Engineering</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Traditionally, environmental engineering was a branch of civil engineering and was variously called sanitary engineering and public health engineering.
However, with the coming of dedicated higher education options in the environment during the 1980s, it found its own niche.
BE/B.Tech in Environmental Engineering is a 4-year program.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="FPE">Fire Protection Engineering </h2>
<p class="paragraph">Fire protection engineers identify risks and design safeguards that aid in preventing, controlling, and mitigating the effects of fires.
Fire engineers assist architects, building owners and developers in evaluating buildings' life safety and property protection goals.
Fire engineers are also employed as fire investigators, including such very large-scale cases as the analysis of the collapse of the World Trade Center.
NASA uses fire engineers in its space program to help improve safety.
Fire engineers are also employed to provide 3rd party review for performance based fire engineering solutions submitted in support of local building regulation
applications.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="IE"> Irrigation Engineering </h2>
<p class="paragraph">Drip irrigation is by far the most efficient use of our water resources - as long as it's designed, installed and maintained correctly.
This is an introductory course for those of you wanting to have a better understanding of both point source and inline drip systems.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="ME">Materials Engineering </h2>
<p class="paragraph">
Students, professors, and researchers in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering explore the relationships between structure and
properties in all classes of materials including metals, ceramics, electronic materials, and biomaterials.
Our research leads to the synthesis of improved materials in response to challenges in the areas of energy, the environment, medicine, and manufacturing.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="UE"> Urban Engineering </H2>
<p class="paragraph">Graduates are employed by civil engineering contractors, consulting engineers, and govermnement departments at local, provincial, or national level.
Broadly speaking civil engineering is divided into two basic activities: planning and design on the one hand, and construction and maintenance on the other.
The work will vary considerably according to the field of employment, but in both fields the technologist will provide in-depth support, sometimes of a highly
specialised nature, to the engineering team.</p><hr class="horizontal-line1" />

<h2 class="heading2" id="WRE"> Water Resources Engineering </h2>
<p class="paragraph">Water management today is faced with new challenges such as climate change or the effects of human activity.
Public and private stakeholders who are active in this field must develop new ways to better manage the water cycle "as a whole".</p><hr class="horizontal-line" />
