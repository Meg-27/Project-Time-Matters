        <h2 class="heading2" id="Heart">Heart</h2>

          <p class="paragraph">The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system.
            The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs.
            In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.
            In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles.
            Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart.
            Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the
            heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow.The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid.
            The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking
            cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the
            conduction  system of the heart.

          <h2 class="heading2" id="Congenital">Congenital</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">A congenital heart defect (CHD), also known as a congenital heart anomaly and congenital heart disease, is a defect in the structure of
            the heart or great vessels that is present at birth. Signs and symptoms depend on the specific type of defect. Symptoms can vary from none to life-threatening.
             When present, symptoms may include rapid breathing, bluish skin (cyanosis), poor weight gain, and feeling tired.

          <h2 class="heading2" id="Arrhythmia">Arrhythmia</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.
            During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm.
            When a heart beats too fast, the condition is called tachycardia. When a heart beats too slowly, the condition is called bradycardia.
            Arrhythmia is caused by changes in heart tissue and activity or in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat.
            These changes can be caused by damage from disease, injury, or genetics.

          <h2 class="heading2" id="Coronary Artery">Coronary Artery</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Coronary circulation is the circulation of blood in the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle (myocardium).
            Coronary arteries supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle, and cardiac veins drain away the blood once it has been deoxygenated. Because the rest of the body,
            and most especially the brain, needs a steady supply of oxygenated blood that is free of all but the slightest interruptions, the heart is required to function continuously.

          <h2 class="heading2" id="Myocardial Infaraction">Myocardial Infaraction</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">A myocardial infarction (MI), also known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to a
            part of the heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder,
            arm, back, neck or jaw.Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes.
            The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn.[1] Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat or feeling tired

          <p class="paragraph">Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF) and congestive cardiac failure (CCF), is when the heart is unable
            to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs.
             Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling.
              The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down, and may wake the person at night.
               A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature.[14] Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.

          <h2 class="heading2" id="Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy">Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which a portion of the heart becomes thickened without an obvious cause.
             This results in the heart being less able to pump blood effectively.[3] Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shortness of breath.
            It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Complications include heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, and sudden cardiac death.

            is a condition in which your heart's mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in your heart.
            If the mitral valve regurgitation is significant, blood can't move through your heart or to the rest of your body as efficiently, making you feel tired or out of breath

            <p class="paragraph">The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails.
              In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart.
              Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide
              from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species.
              Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal
              muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm.
              The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.<br />

            <p class="paragraph">The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system.
              The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum.It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and
              coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body.
              The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head.The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain.
              It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter.
              The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has
              three or four.Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.The frontal lobe is
              associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision.
              Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions.
              Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language
              in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right.The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.<br />

                brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain.
                There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors.
                Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere,

              They receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter,
              a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder.The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.
              Each human adult kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons.
              The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluids, fluid osmolality, acid-base balance, various electrolyte concentrations,
              and removal of toxins. Filtration occurs in the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered.
              Examples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free water, sodium, bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids.Examples of substances secreted are hydrogen,
              ammonium, potassium and uric acid.The kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephron. For example, they convert a precursor of vitamin D
              to its active form, calcitriol; and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin.

                impulses in neurons.In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment,
                regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of
                electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual
                cortex and other areas of the brain.Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex
                optical system.Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.The simplest "eyes", such as those in microorganisms, do nothing but
                detect whether the surroundings are light or dark, which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms.From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive
                ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control

              <p class="paragraph"> The human skin is the outer covering of the body and is the largest organ of the integumentary system.
                The skin has up to seven layers of ectodermal tissue and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs.
                Human skin is similar to most of the other mammals skin, and it is very similar to pig skin. Though nearly all human skin is covered with hair follicles,
                it can appear hairless. There are two general types of skin, hairy and glabrous skin (hairless).
                The adjective cutaneous literally means "of the skin" (from Latin cutis, skin)Because it interfaces with the environment, skin plays an important immunity
                role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, synthesis of
                vitamin D, and the protection of vitamin B folates. Severely damaged skin will try to heal by forming scar tissue. This is often discolored and depigmented.
                In humans, skin pigmentation varies among populations, and skin type can range from dry to non-dry and from oily to non-oily.Such skin variety provides a
                rich and diverse habitat for bacteria that number roughly 1000 species from 19 phyla, present on the human skin.<br />

                Its other roles in metabolism include the regulation of glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, and the production of hormones.
                The liver is an accessory digestive organ that produces bile, an alkaline fluid containing cholesterol and bile acids, which helps the breakdown of fat.
                The gallbladder, a small pouch that sits just under the liver, stores bile produced by the liver which is afterwards moved to the small intestine to
                complete digestion. The liver's highly specialized tissue, consisting of mostly hepatocytes, regulates a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions,
                including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions. Estimates regarding the organ's
                total number of functions vary, but textbooks generally cite it being around 500.<br />
